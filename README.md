# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-and-Pipelines
This is the second assignment I did during the Data Science course. 

In this section I performed spot-checking and k-fold cross-validation for 9 classification models. After coming up with the best fitted model, I did some hyperparameter tuning for that algorithm. And finally, I used pipelines for the same 9 algorithms and also did hyperparameter tuning afterwards for modeling.
